# Java_OOP_Whirlwind

A series of projects designed to solidify my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, data structures, algorithms, and game programming in Java.

## #1 – Pong Game

This project focuses on the implementation of a classic Pong game using Java's object-oriented programming principles. It was designed to help reinforce fundamental OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## #2 – Virtual Pests

The Virtual Pests project models a virtual pet, using a finite state machine to simulate behaviors. I implemented a virtual fish named Fred, along with a custom-designed virtual pet. The project explores state transitions and actions within a controlled simulation.

## #3 – Darwin's World

Darwin's World simulates an evolutionary environment where creatures interact, evolve, and adapt based on programmed behaviors. Each creature belongs to a species that defines its traits and actions. The goal was to create a robust ecosystem where creatures can survive and dominate.

## #4 – MineSweeper Project

A simplified version of the classic Minesweeper game, developed as part of a lab assignment. The game involves uncovering cells on a grid without hitting hidden mines, applying OOP principles to handle game states, logic, and interactions efficiently.

## #5 – Drawable/Scalable Shapes Using Interfaces

This project introduces interfaces and polymorphism in Java by creating shapes that can be drawn and scaled. The shapes were used to animate a picture, demonstrating the power of interfaces in designing flexible and reusable code.

## #6 – Singleton and Adapter Design Patterns

An exploration of two essential design patterns: Singleton and Adapter. I also learned about enums and file I/O in Java, utilizing `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` to process data from external files. This project provided hands-on experience with design patterns and new Java features.

## #7 – Drawable/Scalable Shapes II, Using Inheritance

Building on the previous lab, this project reduces code duplication by introducing inheritance. I implemented a variety of shapes such as Line, Text, Rectangle, and Circle, each inheriting from a base class. The focus was on code reuse and extending functionality through class hierarchies.

## #8 – Recursion

This project explores recursive solutions to various problems, including generating fractal shapes like the Sierpinski triangle. It helped deepen my understanding of recursion and its applications in problem-solving.
